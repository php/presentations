<title>Documentation Improvements</title>

<break/>

<blurb>The current PHP documentation has several blind spots, with many
functions and methods not covered at all. We propose to update and modernize
the English PHP documentation, review and remove user comments, integrate
%https://3v4l.org% for interactive examples, and simplify the maintenance
process. This will make PHP more accessible to new developers and serve as a
reliable reference for experienced ones.</blurb>
