<title>Testing Tool for FPM</title>

<break/>

<blurb>Currently, the PHP project's testing framework lacks more specialized
support for the automated testing of the FastCGI Process Manager (FPM),
especially for issues that require higher load. We propose to develop an
FPM/SAPI testing tool that can execute all applications and set expectations on
the produced logs and server responses. This tool will be connected with a load
testing tool (e.g., wrk) to simulate real-world usage and load.</blurb>

<blurb>The work has started in the %https://github.com/bukka/wst% repository with
the plan to move it to the PHP GitHub organization when ready.</blurb>
